# TESTING

The aim of this document is to provide a basic test plan which asserts the main hardware functions of the device work under Ubuntu snappy.

In summary the functions we will be testing are:

* Flashing a Ninja Sphere with Snappy Ubuntu Core with the Ninja framework
* Connecting the sphere to a wireless network
* Pair the sphere to Ninja Blocks cloud service
* Pair a Zigbee Power Socket
* Check that gestures are working
* Check the LED matrix is working

# SETUP

Ninja blocks provides a firmware archive which needs to be downloaded and installed on a factory sphere.

See flashing document: https://github.com/ninjasphere/ninjasphere-snappy/tree/master/flashing

# TEST PLAN

## Connecting to a Network

Once the sphere is imaged it is ready to be configured.

* Plug in the mini USB cable to the sphere and connect this to a laptop. To access the device you can either use screen or putty. One thing to note is the screen command below is using the device as detected on my OSX laptop, this will be different on Linux platforms.

```
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 115200
```

Note: due to a known issue with the cloud-init component of the Ubuntu Core base image (noted below), the initial login prompt takes between 5-6 minutes on all boots until such time as the WiFi network has been successfully configured.

* Login to the device using the standard snappy user name and password of ubuntu in lower case.

Note: this was changed when moving from the evaluation board to the NinjaSphere hardware. The NinjaSphere Images come with a username "ninja" and a default password "temppwd".

* Use sudo to login as root.

```
sudo -i
```

* Use `wpa_cli` to configure the wireless interface.

```

* Note down the the serial number, this will need to be entered to pair and the device, one thing to note this is case sensitive.

```
echo $(sphere-serial)
```

* Reboot the device.

```
reboot
```

## Logging in using SSH

* Just to verify network is working you can ssh into the device, where `x.x.x.x` is the IP address assigned to your ninja sphere or `webdm.local`.

```
ssh ubuntu@x.x.x.x
```

## Testing the Zigbee Stack

The software which drives the zigbee chip is provided by Texas Instruments, we are going to run through using this to connect and control a Zigbee power socket.

Login to the Ninja Sphere via with SSH as the ubuntu user

	# stop the Ninja Sphere driver
    sudo systemctl stop driver-go-zigbee_driver-go-zigbee_0.1.6-7.service

    # start the TI user interface
	(cd /apps/zigbee-zstack-gateway/current/servers/; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./start_application)

At this point you should see a screen like ![this](images/zigbee-started.png) <!--https://www.dropbox.com/s/ej506gcj9rowx1k/Screenshot%202015-03-23%2015.50.04.png?dl=0-->

Now:

* remove power from the zigbee socket
* depress the reset button on the right hand side of the zigbee socket with a pen or similar object
* while holding down the reset button, apply power to the zigbee socket
* wait until both LEDs on the zigbee socket turn green and start flashing
* release the reset button
* remove power from the zigbee socket
* wait for the LEDs to fade
* apply power to the zigbee socket.
* the socket is now in pairing mode.

Back in the TI interface, hit 'P' (PERMIT_JOIN) to put the Ninja Sphere into pairing mode. If successful, you should see a device appear as in ![this image](images/zigbee-paired.png)<!--https://www.dropbox.com/s/bqk6dnmdbc9y2ml/Screenshot%202015-03-23%2015.54.52.png?dl=0).-->

Hit 'D' to move to the devices section. Use the arrow keys to select the device labelled 'MAINS POWER OUTLET' so that the '>' is next to that device.

Hit 'N' to turn the device on. Hit 'F' to turn the device off. You should hear a click from the socket as it turns on and off.

## Pairing to Ninja Blocks Cloud

* Once your able to connect with screen/putty again the device is ready to pair. Sign up for an account at [Sphere Identity site](https://id.sphere.ninja/) then navigate to [API Site](https://api.sphere.ninja) which should once loaded look like the image below.
![Pairing Site Screen Shot](images/pairing_site.png)

* Once you have entered the serial and hit the Pair button the device should wake up and show a clock on the top.

## Setting up your Sphere Site

This section will be run from an Ubuntu machine on your network. It will require the following packages:
```
apt-get install -y jq curl mosquitto-clients
```

Next, we will set a shell variable containing the IP address of your Sphere on the network (the same as used to SSH above):
```
sphere_ip=x.x.x.x
```

For convenience, use the following to grab the site ID of your sphere, this should print a UUID:
```
site_id=$(curl -s http://$sphere_ip:8000/rest/v1/sites | jq -r '.data[0].id'); echo $site_id
```

Now update your site to have a latitude/longitude of your chosing, in this example we're using a place in Taipei, Taiwan. Note that it must be a valid lat/long that has an associated city:
```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"'$site_id'","name":"Home","type":"home","longitude":121.6333,"latitude":25.0333}' http://$sphere_ip:8000/rest/v1/sites/$site_id
```

## Setting up a LIFX

To begin, download the LIFX app and pair it to your WiFi network (the same network the Sphere is connected to), and make sure you can control it successfully from the LIFX app. If it is not controllable from the LIFX app, it will not work with the Sphere.

The packages from the above Sphere Site setup are also assumed to be installed.

Because the Snappy Ubuntu Core system does not currently allow frameworks to specify any sort of dependency ordering in systemd, the LIFX driver needs to be restarted to ensure that HomeCloud is running before it starts. Run the following on the *sphere*:
```
sudo systemctl restart sphere-driver-lifx_sphere-driver-lifx_1.1.0.service
```

Now, back to your Ubuntu desktop. Since the LIFX driver is running, it should detect the LIFX bulb automatically. To get a list of the IDs of the LIFX bulbs paired (should output a UUID):
```
lifx_id=$(curl -s http://$sphere_ip:8000/rest/v1/things | jq -r '.data[] | select(.type == "light") | .id'); echo $lifx_id
```

If the output of this command is blank, then open the LiFX app on the phone and toggle the light on and off to confirm connectivity with the LiFX bulb and then retry the step above.

Providing this worked, you turn this LIFX bulb on/off:
```
on_off_channel=$(curl -s http://$sphere_ip:8000/rest/v1/things/$lifx_id | jq -r '.data.device.channels[] | select(.protocol == "on-off") | .topic'); echo $on_off_channel

while true; do
  #turn it on;
  mosquitto_pub -h $sphere_ip -t $on_off_channel -m '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "turnOn", "params": [], "id": "123"}';
  sleep 1;
  #turn it off;
  mosquitto_pub -h $sphere_ip -t $on_off_channel -m '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "turnOff", "params": [], "id": "123"}';
  sleep 1;
done
```


# COMPLETION

At the end of this process you should have a ninja sphere running snappy that is connected and paired to the ninja blocks cloud service over wireless. The device should respond to gestures, this will wake up the display and show the clock.

# KNOWN ISSUES

While porting the ninja sphere to snappy we encountered some issues, work arounds have been created for most but there are still some rather pointy ones.

* Initial boot up takes 360 seconds when there is no network access, this is attributed to the way networking is configured in the current release of snappy, we have raised this with the Ubuntu team.

* App Armor profiles are problematic while upgrading snaps, we have observed cases were changes to the profiles aren't propegated and we need to force a reload using the aa-* commands. This shouldn't affect testing, unless updates are pulled down.

* Bluetooth, although this is a feature of our ninja sphere we are unable to demonstrate it at this stage due to the complexity in packaging bluez in a snap package. We are hoping to work with Ubuntu to come up with a nice solution for this.

* Frameworks cannot specify systemd dependency order, so drivers start before HomeCloud is running. They must be restarted later, before use. Once apps can have dependencies on systemd services from a required framework, we can fix this issue.
